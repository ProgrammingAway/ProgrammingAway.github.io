attempted to control the garage door and sensors using a Raspberry Pi with some
glue logic hooked up to the GPIO pins.  I loosely followed a guide for a project
called <a href="https://lowpowerlab.com/guide/gateway/">IoT Gateway</a> from a site called
Low Power Lab.  That introduced me to the programming language NodeJS.  I
learned a lot from this project, which involved programming, circuitry, and
controlling the circuits from the program.  I got the project to work, however,
it wasn&rsquo;t long before I learned the Raspberry Pi wouldn&rsquo;t last too long in the
evnironment of my garage.  I later moved to NexxGarage for my garage opener.
It served it&rsquo;s purpose for a while, but I still didn&rsquo;t like how NexxGarage
connected to other servers.  Something as simple as a garage opener shouldn&rsquo;t
connect to another company&rsquo;s servers.  I started learning about ESP8266 and how
that would withstand the temperature range of my garage. (I later
learned the NexxGarage contains an ESP8266).  So I bought a NodeMCU and
interfaced it with the previous circuits I used with my Pi.  I then dusted off
my old C language skills and created an Arduino sketch based off of
<a href="https://selfhostedhome.com">https://selfhostedhome.com</a>.  (Although now he uses MicroPython).  Then since I
used HomeAssistant for my home automation, I was able to handle the
functionality using the ESPhome firmware (used specifically for HomeAssistant)
and customized yaml files.  This has worked great for the longest time, but now
I am interested in taking out the middle-man (HomeAssistant) so I can still
control my garage even if Home Assistant is down indefinately after the latest
update.  As for the hardware, the NodeMCU and extra circuitry are tried and
tested.  I just need a new firmware to control that hardware.  That leads me
back to C/C++ using Arduino, or try something new like MicroPython.  The easiest
method would be to use my old sketch and be done with it.  However, I seem to
make things more difficult for myself, so I am going to try something new.  I am
already familiar with Python, so using it on a microcontroller should be a piece
of cake.</p>
