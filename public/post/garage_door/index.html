<p>I have done many attempts to control my garage door with my phone over the years. I first attempted to control the garage door using sensors and relays and a Raspberry Pi. I loosely followed a guide for a project called <a href="https://lowpowerlab.com/guide/gateway/">IoT Gateway</a> from a site called Low Power Lab. That introduced me to the programming language NodeJS. I learned a lot from this project, which involved programming, circuitry, and controlling the circuits from the program. I got the project to work, however, it wasn’t long before I learned the Raspberry Pi wasn’t built for my garage environment.</p>
<p>I then moved to <a href="https://getnexx.com/products/nexx-garage">NexxGarage</a> for my connected garage opener. This was an off the shelf solution so it used someone else’s hardware and software.  It served its purpose for a while, but unfortunately it also used NexxGarage’s servers for their service. Something as simple as a garage opener shouldn’t need to connect to another company’s servers. I started learning about ESP8266 and how that can withstand the temperature range of my garage. (I later learned the NexxGarage contains an ESP8266). So I bought a <a href="http://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html">NodeMCU</a> and interfaced it with the previous circuits I used with my Raspberry Pi. I then dusted off my old C language skills and created an Arduino sketch based off of a project from <a href="https://selfhostedhome.com/">Self Hosted Home</a> (although now he uses MicroPython).</p>
<p>The NodeMCU with the arduino sketch worked well for a while.  But in my continuing research, I learned about <a href="https://esphome.io/">ESPhome</a> which is custom firmware for ESP8266/NodeMCU that can connect directly with <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>.  Since I use Home Assistant for my home automation, I decided to give it a try. After customizing some yaml files, this solution was simple and has worked great for quite some time.</p>
<p>However, after my latest update to Home Assistant messed up my connection to some other devices, I am now interested in having alternative ways of controlling my devices. I have a MQTT server and could just add MQTT functionality to my ESPhome firmware, but I am thinking of using something not specifically built for Home Assistant. The hardware I have is tried and tested, I just need a new firmware to control that hardware. That leads me back to C/C++ using Arduino, or try something new like <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a>. The easiest method would be to use my old sketch and be done with it. However, I seem to make things more difficult for myself, so I am going to try something new. I am already familiar with Python, so using it on a micro-controller should be a piece of cake, right?</p>
<p>Well, we shall find out. I will document my progress on this site, but if you have any questions or comments about my journey so far, feel free to leave it in the comments below.</p>
