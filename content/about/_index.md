My name is Brian Ladner and I am starting this blog to document my journey to learn programming.  I started this journey about 25 years ago when I took computer science courses in college and learned C.  I ended college with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.  Today, that would be called a computer engineering degree.  Once my career as a CMOS chip designer started after college, I never had much time for programming.  Every couple of years, I would pick it back up again and work on a project, but then just as quickly, put it down again.  Along the way, I learned some C++, Java, HTML/CSS, javascript, nodeJS, and Python, but never practiced enough to keep these skills sharp.  However, once Covid started, I took the CS50X online course from Harvard and made a commitment to become a programmer.  I have since loaded up on Udemy courses when they go on sale.  However, I think my main issue now is I need to learn by doing, not listening.  So this blog will show my projects I am working on and hopefully talk about how I overcame tough problems in my code.  You can check out my small github repository at [ProgrammingAway](https://github.com/ProgrammingAway/).  

Here are other interests I have besides programming:
 - Home servers
 - Virtualization (I use proxmox)
 - Docker (I have a lot of self-hosted services)
 - Home Automation (HomeAssistant, NodeRed, etc.)
 - Embeded Hardware/Software (ESP8266, Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
 - Privacy, de-googling, and protecting my own data (this is a work in progress)
 - Open Source Software
 - LSU Football
 - And probably other stuff


Also, once I install [Commento](https://commento.io/), I will have comments on this blog.  And if you want, you can tell me other topics you would like to see here.
